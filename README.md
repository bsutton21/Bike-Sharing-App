The dataset was found at Kaggle.com and processed and stored in dataframes using Pandas and Numpy.  The prediction model is the Scikit-Learn RandomForestRegressor.  Flask was used for the base app and Plotly Dash was used for the interactive visualizations.  The initial visualizations in Jupyter Notebook were made with Matplotlib.  The app was deployed on Heroku.com:
