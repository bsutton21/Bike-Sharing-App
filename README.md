# Bike-Sharing-App
Bike Prediction Web App Implemented with Python (Flask and Dash)

The dataset was found at Kaggle.com and processed and stored in dataframes using Pandas and Numpy. The prediction model is the Scikit-Learn RandomForestRegressor. Flask was used for the base app and Plotly Dash was used for the interactive visualizations. The initial visualizations in Jupyter Notebook were made with Matplotlib.  The app is deployed on render.com using their free tier service. The free instance may require time to spin up on the first attempt.

Note: This was migrated from Heroku to Render and is running on a free-tier instance, which can take some time to spin up if it hasn't been accessed in a while. Subsequent visits within a short timeframe will be quicker as will visits to other pages within the app. Due to this being free-tier, the resources devoted to the instance are also very limited so I've notied that the interactive graphs do take some time to load.
