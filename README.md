# Bike-Sharing-App
Bike Prediction Web App Implemented with Python (Flask and Dash)

The dataset was found at Kaggle.com and processed and stored in dataframes using Pandas and Numpy. The prediction model is the Scikit-Learn RandomForestRegressor. Flask was used for the base app and Plotly Dash was used for the interactive visualizations. The initial visualizations in Jupyter Notebook were made with Matplotlib.  The app is deployed on render.com using their free tier service. The free instance may require time to spin up on the first attempt.
